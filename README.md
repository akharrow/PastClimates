# PastClimates

This repository is a collection of useful data and code for plotting past climate changes. The data currently archived here are Supplements to the review paper *Past climates inform our future*, currently under revision.


## List of files

`co2Binned.csv`
This file contains binned estimates of past carbon dioxide levels based on multiple proxies (stomata, paleosols, algal lipids, boron isotopes). The bins are larger moving back in time, in accordance with data availibility. The CO<sub>2</sub> proxy data include the collection of Foster et al. (2017) *Nature Communications* as well as data published since then, including new boron data (Super et al., 2018; Sosdian et al., 2018; Henehan et al., 2019) and phytane data (Witkowski et al., 2018). For each time bin, available data and their accompanying 1-sigma ranges were averaged together. Data with mean values below 150 ppm were excluded from the bin average on the basis that this level of CO<sub>2</sub> is below the lowest values observed during the Late Pleistocene glaciations from the ice core record and therefore not physically plausible (especially for warmer Mesozoic and Cenozoic climates).
